# 🌤️ MERN Weather App

A feature-rich weather application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **Redux**. This app provides real-time weather updates, 7-day forecasts, and an interactive map-based weather lookup. Designed with user experience in mind, the app leverages **JWT authentication** for secure user sessions and integrates the **Google Maps API** for dynamic location-based functionality.
